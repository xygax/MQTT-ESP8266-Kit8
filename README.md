# MQTT-ESP8266-Kit8

I wanted multiple clients to stuff info to the same topic and get acknolagement from the broker 

Its a bit rough and ready from information gleaned from various places. 
you need to provide SSID and password for the wifi 

It uses the mac address as the identiy of the device and the outputm needs a UID as these were to be published to the same topic
fill in the stars at the top and it works sending messages once every 5 mins as a CSV file for use later in Excel ect
